### Introduction
######################

This module allows a set of cookies to be returned as a JSON or
JSONP response. The main use case for this is to be able to retrieve
data stored in the cookie for domain X, while the call comes from
domain Y.

This is quite common when operating widgets or other utilitarian
JavaScript as a service for third party webpages.

######################
### Example
######################

A call to an endpoint with this module enabled might look like this:

  curl -H 'Cookie: a=1' -H 'Cookie: b=2; c=3' http://example.com

And the resulting JSON response would look like this:

  { "a": "1", "b": "2", "c": "3" }

Alternately, a call to the endpoint while callbacks are enabled might
look like this:

  curl -H 'Cookie: a=1' -H 'Cookie: b=2; c=3' http://example.com?callback=cb

And the resulting JSONP response would look like this:

  cb({
    status: 200,
    body: { "a": "1", "b": "2", "c": "3" }
  });

### Configuration
######################

Note: All the directives can be either set in the server config, virtual host,
directory or .htaccess sections of the configuration.

*** C2JSON directive
    Syntax:     C2JSON on|off
    Default:    C2JSON off

    When mod_cookie2json is loaded, and C2JSON on is set, Apache will convert
    will read the 'Cookie:' headers from the request and convert them into a
    JSON or JSONP response.

    This directive can be used to turn this behavior on or off on a per-server
    or per-directory basis. By default, enabling the mod_cookie2json module will
    not trigger this behaviour, unless this directive is set to 'On'.

    ***NOTE*** This module short cuts the request/response cycle by preparing a
    response body inside the module. That means that it is best to have a dedicated
    <Location> directive for this module, as it stops Apache from retrieving a file
    from disk or passing the request on via ProxyPass or WSGI/mod_perl, etc.

*** C2JSONCallBackNameFrom directive
    Syntax:     C2JSONCallBackNameFrom token
    Default:    NULL

    This directive allows you to dynamically set the callback name based on the
    query parameters that are being sent. For example, if this directive was set
    to 'callback', the following call:

      curl -H 'Cookie: a=1' -H 'Cookie: b=2; c=3' http://example.com?callback=cb

    Would result in a JSONP response like this:

      cb({
        status: 200,
        body: { "a": "1", "b": "2", "c": "3" }
      });

    If this directive is set, but the parameter is not found in the query string,
    this module will fall back to a standard JSON response. ie, in the above
    example, if the query string were omitted, the response would be:

      { "a": "1", "b": "2", "c": "3" }

    The callback parameter is validated to ensure it only contains characters that
    could be used to define a JS function w/o using quotes on the keys. This prevents
    arbitrary code execution, but also means the callback cannot be a quoted
    dereference of a JS object (e.g., a.b.c is ok, but a['b'].c is not). The allowed
    characters are:

      [a-zA-Z0-9._]

    If the callback does not validate, then the response will be a 400, which can be
    configured to provide a custom body (see: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/custom-error.html).

*** C2JSONPrefix directive
    Syntax:     C2JSONPrefix String1 String2 ...
    Default:    NULL

    This directive allows you to selectively return key/value pairs from the
    'Cookie:' header in a JSON/JSONP response. By setting this directive, every
    cookie key will be matched against every prefix; if the cookie key starts with
    the prefix as listed in this directive, it will be included in the response.
    If not, it will be silently dropped.

    This allows you to explicitly white list the sets of cookies you are willing
    to expose to a third party. Its use is recommended.

*** C2JSONCallBackPrefix directive
    Syntax:     C2JSONCallBackPrefix String1 String2 ...
    Default:    NULL

    This directive restricts the value taken from the param named in C2JSONCallBackNameFrom
    allowing only those that start with the provided prefix(es). If no setting is given, then
    prefix validation is skipped. If a callback is supplied and there is no matching prefix
    response will be a HTTP 400 Bad Request. The prefix is matched disregarding case.

    For example, if this directive is set to `C2JSONCallBackPrefix foo baz`, the following call:

      curl -H 'Cookie: a=1' -H 'Cookie: b=2; c=3' http://example.com?callback=foo_bar_baz

    Would result in a JSONP response like this:

      foo_bar_baz({
        status: 200,
        body: { "a": "1", "b": "2", "c": "3" }
      });

    Another example, if the value is again set to 'foo baz', the following call:

      curl -H 'Cookie: a=1' -H 'Cookie: b=2; c=3' http://example.com?callback=BAZ_QUX

    Would result in a JSONP response like this:

      BAZ_QUX({
        status: 200,
        body: { "a": "1", "b": "2", "c": "3" }
      });

    While a call like:

      curl -H 'Cookie: a=1' -H 'Cookie: b=2; c=3' http://example.com?callback=bar_baz

    Would result in an HTTP 400 Bad Request.
